1. Compile or assemble submitted program
2. If program does not assemble- exit
3. Copy or load or assemble test files
	Steps 1,3 can be encapsulated in a makefile (hlab4)
4. Actually run the program using lc3sim script
5. Compare output
	5.1 Register- grep register value from lc3sim script output and compare with expected output
	5.2 Memory location- use dump command in lc3sim script to output memory locations of interest and grep
						to pick out the line(s) with output to be compared
	5.3 Print to screen using OUT or PUTS- Redirect/Store output in a file and diff with expected output
6. Checking return value of comparision and assigning points
Note- Output appropriate information to a grade.txt file. (Use stdout and stderr redirection)
