Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab12.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

14: illegal operands for missing opcode      misssing .ORIG
 16: instruction appears before .ORIG        fixed by adding .ORIG at 14
 17: constant outside of allowed range       fixed by labeling R2V
 19: illegal operands for ADD                extra ,
 30: constant outside of allowed range       fixed by labeling R50
 32: label OUTERLOOP has already appeared    should be BRzp
 35: constant outside of allowed range       fixed by labeling RESULT
 43: no .END directive found                 as stated 



Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

Symbol Name       Page Address
//	----------------  ------------
//	OUTERLOOP         3005
//	INNERLOOP         3006
//	INPUT             300F
//	R50               3010
//	R2V               3011
//	RESULT            3012




Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?

labels.
